Q.
Compare and contrast a text editor and an IDE, highlighting their key features and uses.


Ans.
Text Editors and IDEs both can be used for writing codes, but each has their seperate features. Each one is decribed as below:

1. Text Editors:
-> Text editors are designed for writing code and performing basic tasks such as cutting, pasting, and finding and replacing text. 
They are also capable of opening and reading large files quickly. Text editors are simpler and require fewer hardware resources, 
such as memory and processing power, compared to IDEs. Some popular text editors are - 'Sublime Text', 'Notepad++', 'Visual Studio
Code' and 'Vim'.
        
    Key Features of text editors:
        a. Lightweight and Fast: Quick to load and responsive, even on less powerful hardware.
        b. Syntax Highlighting: Highlights syntax for various programming languages to improve readability.
        c. Customization: Highly customizable with themes, plugins, and extensions.
        d. Basic Code Navigation: Line numbers, basic search, and navigation tools.
        e. Cross-Platform Availability: Available on multiple operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    Uses of text editors:
        a. Writing and editing code for small projects or scripts.
        b. Quickly editing configuration files and large text files.
        c. Basic programming tasks without the need for extensive features. 


2. IDEs:
-> IDEs or 'Integrated Development Environments' are designed for developing, testing, and previewing code projects. They typically 
include a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, all accessible through a unified graphical user interface (GUI). 
The code editor is where the developer writes and edits source code, which the compiler then translates into  the machine-readable 
language that can be executed by a computer. IDEs often demand more hardware resources, compared to text editors, that's why they're
so capable. Examples of IDEs include - 'Codeanywhere', 'Eclipse', 'PyCharm' and 'NetBeans'.

    Key Features of IDEs:
        a. Integrated Tools: Combines code editor, compiler, debugger, and other tools within one application.
        b. Code Completion: Offers intelligent code suggestions and auto-completion to speed up coding.
        c. Advanced Debugging: Provides breakpoints, step-through debugging, and variable inspection.
        d. Project Management: Manages complex projects with multiple files and dependencies.
        e. Version Control Integration: Built-in support for version control systems like Git. 

    Uses of IDEs:
        a. Developing complex software projects that require integrated tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
        b. Collaborating on projects with integrated version control systems.
        c. Testing and previewing code within the development environment.
