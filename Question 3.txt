Q. 
Describe the role of a web browser's developer tools in web development.


Ans.
Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave etc. are used to browse the internet. But they also have an important tool for developers, 
called 'developer tools' or 'dev tools'. These tools can help developers to test and debug the web app. Nowadays almost all web browsers
come equipeed with these tools. These can be brought up by right clicking any page and clicking 'Inspect' option, or using the shortcut
'Shift + Ctrl + I'. This gives access to many tools, listed as follows:

    1. Elements Tool: 
    -> This tool offers a DOM view, allowing you to inspect and debug the HTML and CSS code of a webpage. It also enables live editing of 
    CSS, so you can see changes immediately in the browser.

    2. Console Tool: 
    -> This tool displays messages, errors, and warnings related to the webpage's JavaScript code. It also lets users write JavaScript code 
    to retrieve information or manipulate the DOM.

    3. Sources Tool: 
    -> Acting as an in-browser editor, this tool provides various debugging utilities. It is particularly useful for editing JS files and
    using breakpoints to debug code without needing an external IDE.

    4. Network Tool: 
    -> This tool shows network requests and responses, offering details about the resources being downloaded or uploaded. It provides the 
    information such as resource type, size, and HTTP response status codes.

    5. Performance Tool: 
    -> This tool is used to analyze the performance of a fully loaded webpage. It helps you assess memory and CPU usage, presenting all the 
    data in tables and graphs for easier analysis.

    6. Memory Tool: 
    -> This tool checks the webpage's memory usage, helping to identify potential memory leaks. It allows you to view and debug memory that 
    hasn't been garbage collected.

    7. Security Tool: 
    -> This tool displays the security status of the webpage, including checking for valid HTTPS usage by the server. It provides details on 
    certificates, encryption, and authentication for the various resources used by the webpage.
